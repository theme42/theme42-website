Theme42 Event Platform Overview
Theme42.org is a community-driven platform for AI/GenAI meetup events that connect businesses with IT professionals. The website will function as a lightweight event management site, enabling visitors to:
Browse upcoming and past events (with dates, locations, and status)
Register for events using secure email/Google authentication (Firebase Auth)
View detailed event pages (agenda schedule, speakers, location map, sponsor info)
Join a waitlist if an event is at capacity, and receive notifications if spots open
Learn about Theme42.org’s mission and supporting sponsors
Get email notifications for confirmations, reminders, or updates
The goal is a lean, easily maintainable site that leverages Google Sheets as a simple CMS for event data, minimizing custom admin interfaces. (Using Google Sheets is familiar to non-technical organizers and saves development time on a custom dashboard​

.) The UI will have a modern dark theme, support English and French content, and scale for future features like paid events or expanded community tools.
Technology Stack
Hosting & Backend: Firebase – Using Firebase Hosting (includes free SSL) and Cloud Firestore as the primary database. This provides a secure, serverless backend for storing events, registrations, etc., with real-time sync to the frontend. Firebase Hosting automatically serves content over SSL for security​

.
Database: Cloud Firestore – A NoSQL cloud database to store event info, user registrations, waitlists, and sponsor details. Firestore will be updated via an integration with Google Sheets, allowing organizers to manage event content in a spreadsheet that syncs to the site.
CMS (Admin Updates): Google Sheets – Acts as a lightweight CMS for event data. Organizers can update a Google Sheet (with tabs like “Events”, “Agenda”, “Sponsors”, “Participants”), and these changes sync to Firestore (via a scheduled script or Cloud Function). This approach lets non-developers easily edit content in a familiar interface​

, avoiding the need for a custom admin panel.
User Authentication: Firebase Authentication – Supports Google Sign-In and email/password login. Users must authenticate to register for events, ensuring valid email addresses. (Email verification can be enforced via Firebase Auth settings.)
Event Registration & Notifications: Registrations are stored in Firestore (and optionally mirrored in Google Sheets for organizer reference). Use SendGrid (or Firebase Extensions) for sending confirmation emails, reminders before the event, and waitlist notifications.
Bilingual Support: All content will be available in English and French. We’ll use either a i18n library (if using React) or dynamic content from Firestore for each language. The site will include a language toggle switch in the header for easy switching.
Payments (Future): Stripe integration is planned for future paid events (not in initial launch). The codebase will be structured to add Stripe checkout for event tickets or sponsorships later on.
Analytics: Google Analytics 4 (GA4) will be used to track user interactions (page views, registration funnel, etc.), providing insights into engagement.
Security: All traffic is HTTPS (managed by Firebase’s free SSL). Firestore security rules will restrict data access: for example, only authenticated users can write to the “Participants” collection (to register), and read access to certain data is limited to admin accounts.
Site Structure & Key Pages
Homepage: The homepage will introduce Theme42’s mission and highlight upcoming events. A hero section will have a brief mission statement and a call-to-action (“Join our next event” or “View Events”). Below that, a list of the next few upcoming events (title, date, location) with a “Register” button for each will be displayed. Sponsor logos might be showcased in a carousel or grid to thank the organizations supporting Theme42. A language switch (EN/FR) toggle will be visible in the top navigation for easy bilingual access.
Events Listing Page: A dedicated page to list all events with filters for upcoming vs. past events. Each event entry shows the name, date, location, and registration status (Open, Full, or Waitlist available). For upcoming events, users can click “Register” (which brings them to the event detail or login flow). Past events may link to recaps or photos. This page gives an overview of the event history and what’s coming next.
Event Details Page: Each event will have its own detail page. This includes:
Event overview: title, date & time, location (with a Google Maps link or embed), and capacity info (e.g. “100 spots (10 left)”).
Agenda: A breakdown of the schedule (timeslots with topics, speaker names, and descriptions). This can be pulled from the “Agenda” tab in Google Sheets.
Speakers/Sponsors: Highlight any notable speakers and list sponsors for that event (with logos or descriptions).
Registration section: If the event is still open and the user isn’t registered yet, show a registration form. Since we require login, this section might prompt the user to log in via Google or email. Once logged in, a “Register for this Event” button (or form) appears, possibly asking a couple of questions (name, company, etc., which can be pre-filled from their profile or required on first signup).
Waitlist handling: If the event is full, the registration form is replaced by a “Join Waitlist” option. Users on the waitlist are stored in a separate subcollection. If a spot opens (an existing registrant cancels), we could email the waitlisted users in order.
Post-registration state: If the user is already registered, the page will say “You’re registered!” and maybe offer an “Add to Calendar” link (which could be an iCal file or Google Calendar link) and any additional instructions (like “Check your email for confirmation”).
Registration Confirmation Page: After a user successfully registers (or joins the waitlist), they are redirected to a confirmation page. This page thanks them for registering and provides details: event name, date/time, and a note that a confirmation email has been sent. We’ll include buttons like “Add to Google Calendar” or “Add to Outlook Calendar” for convenience. This page might also suggest following Theme42 on social media or share the event with friends. (Email confirmations are sent in the background via SendGrid/Firebase Cloud Functions.)
About & Contact Page: A static page describing Theme42.org’s mission (“to foster a community around AI and GenAI by connecting professionals…”). It will list the core team or organizers, and acknowledge sponsors/partners in more detail. A simple contact form will allow users to send inquiries or partnership requests (the form can send an email to organizers, or write to Firestore where admins can read it). Also, provide social media links or a community forum link if available.
Design and UX Considerations
Example of a dark-themed event listing interface (Meetup mobile app in dark mode). The site will adopt a modern dark theme for its UI. Dark backgrounds with light text give a sleek, professional look and can reduce eye strain in low-light environments​

. To maintain readability, we will ensure strong contrast between text and background colors and use vibrant accent colors for clickable elements (like the “Register” buttons)​
mycodelesswebsite.com
. For example, important calls-to-action might be highlighted in a bright color (orange or teal, etc.) against the dark background to stand out. This aligns with modern design trends – many users now expect a dark mode option for comfort and aesthetics.
The layout will be mobile-first and fully responsive. Given that over half of web traffic worldwide comes from mobile devices​
lyssna.com
, the site is designed to work flawlessly on smartphones and tablets. This means menus, event cards, and forms will be optimized for small screens (e.g. a collapsible navigation menu, touch-friendly buttons, and minimal text entry for forms). On larger screens, the design can expand to utilize space (for instance, an events grid or sidebar on desktop), but mobile usability is the priority.
Bilingual support is a core requirement – users can switch between English and French easily. The language toggle will be prominently placed (likely in the top-right corner of the nav bar). Ensuring the toggle is highly visible is important for a good UX on a multilingual site​
weglot.com
. We will likely label it “EN | FR” or use a globe/flag icon with a dropdown. All page content, including navigation labels, event details, and form fields, will be available in both languages. (Content from Firestore/Sheets can include language fields, or we’ll use a translation library for static text.)
The overall style will be clean and minimalistic – focusing on the content (event information and calls-to-action). We want to avoid clutter, so each page section has a clear purpose. Generous spacing, simple typography, and consistent styling will be used so that users can quickly scan for the information they need.
Execution Plan (Phased Approach)
Phase 1: Initial Setup
Firebase Project & Firestore: Set up the Firebase project and deploy an initial version of the site on Firebase Hosting (which provides instant SSL). Create Firestore collections for Events, Participants, Sponsors, etc. with appropriate indexes. Prepare security rules (e.g., only authenticated users can add to Participants).
Authentication Configuration: Enable Firebase Auth providers (Google Sign-In and Email/Password). Implement a basic login flow on the site – e.g., a “Login” button that triggers Firebase Auth UI or a custom form. Ensure that certain actions (like registering for an event) prompt login if the user isn’t already authenticated.
Google Sheets CMS Integration: Set up a Google Sheet for event management. For example: one sheet tab for “Events” (event_id, title, date, location, capacity, description, etc.), another for “Agenda” (linked by event_id, with entries for each agenda item), and maybe “Sponsors” (names, logos, links) and “Participants” (to log registrations). Write a Google Apps Script (or use an automation tool like Zapier/Integromat) to sync data from the Google Sheet to Firestore. This could run on edits or periodically. For instance, when organizers update event details in the sheet, the script updates the Firestore Events document. (Using Google Sheets allows organizers to easily update events without a dev, and then the site reflects the changes​
stackoverflow.com
.)
Basic Frontend Structure: Begin developing the frontend (likely using a framework like React for its Firebase integration libraries and ease of building a single-page app). Implement the homepage with a list of upcoming events fetched from Firestore. Set up routing for the main pages (Events list, Event detail, About, etc.). At this stage, use placeholder text and simple layouts – focusing on getting data flow working: e.g., read events from Firestore and display them.
Phase 2: Event Registration & Syncing
Event Detail & Registration Form: Build out the Event Details page to show real data (agenda, etc.). Incorporate the registration form component on this page. The form flow: if user not logged in, show a login prompt; if logged in and event open, show “Register” button (or small form to capture any extra fields like “Company” or “Role”). On submit, create a record in Firestore (e.g., add a document in Participants with event_id, user info, timestamp). Also append to Google Sheets “Participants” via the sync (could call a Cloud Function to append to the sheet or just rely on Firestore as primary). Immediately show confirmation UI (and trigger confirmation email).
Waitlist Logic: Implement logic to check event capacity before finalizing registration. Each event in Firestore can store a capacity and a registeredCount. When a new registration comes in, if registeredCount < capacity, proceed as normal and increment the count. If the event is full, instead add the user to a Waitlist subcollection. The UI should inform the user they’ve been added to the waitlist. We’ll also set up an automated way to move people from waitlist to registered if space opens: for example, if someone cancels (their record is removed), a Cloud Function could find the earliest waitlisted user and notify them.
Email Notifications: Integrate an email service for transactional emails. Using SendGrid via a Cloud Function is one approach (Firebase has an extension that triggers on new Firestore entries to send emails). When a user registers, we send a “Thank you for registering” email with event details. As the event date approaches, organizers can send a reminder to all participants (this could be done by marking something in the sheet or a Cloud Function scheduled 1 day before event). Also, if a waitlisted user is moved to confirmed, an email is sent to let them know they’re in.
Testing Data Flow: At this phase, test end-to-end: Updating an event in Google Sheets should reflect on the site; a user registering on the site should appear in Firestore (and perhaps populate the sheet via the script), and they should receive an email. Fix any issues with auth (e.g., ensure only logged-in users can write to Firestore by testing security rules).
Phase 3: Finalization & Deployment
Polish UI/UX: Apply the finalized design theme – the dark color scheme, bilingual text, responsive layouts. This includes refining the CSS or theme in the React app to match the intended dark mode style (ensuring contrast and accessibility, e.g., using ARIA labels and alt text where needed). Test the layout on various devices and screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) to iron out any responsive bugs. Also implement the language toggle functionality: likely by loading the appropriate language content (if using i18n JSON files or Firestore documents for each language).
Performance Optimizations: Because Firebase Hosting is a CDN, the site will already load fast. We will enable text compression and proper caching via Firebase’s configuration. Also, load only necessary Firebase SDK modules to keep the bundle lean. Possibly implement code-splitting for routes so that the event pages load faster.
Security & Analytics: Double-check Firestore Security Rules – e.g., events collection might be read-only to everyone (since it’s public info), but writes only allowed for admin; participants collection allows new documents by authenticated users but no reading of others’ data (to protect privacy). Set up Google Analytics 4 and test that page views and events (like “Registration Completed”) are tracked correctly. This data will help measure engagement.
Quality Assurance: Conduct thorough testing of all flows. This includes: registering for an event (both when spots are available and when it’s full to test waitlist), switching languages to see that all text changes accordingly, using the contact form, and viewing on different devices/browsers. Additionally, test the Google Sheets sync by updating content and ensuring the site updates. Any issues (like sync delays or formatting problems) can be addressed (for example, if using Apps Script, ensure it triggers on edits or every few minutes).
Launch: Once everything is verified, do a final deploy to Firebase Hosting. Announce the site to the community. After launch, monitor Firebase Analytics and logs. We’ll watch for any errors (using Firebase Logging/Crashlytics for frontend errors) and gather user feedback. From here, the site can be iteratively improved (for instance, the next steps might include implementing the Stripe payment for ticketed events, or adding a blog section for event recaps, etc.).
Next Steps
With the initial version live, the focus will shift to content and community engagement. The organizers can start populating the Google Sheets with real event data and use the platform to manage RSVPs. We will continue to refine the bilingual content based on any feedback from English and French users (ensuring translations are clear). On the development side, upcoming enhancements could include integrating calendar invites (automatically sending a .ics calendar file in confirmation emails), adding a “My Events” page for users to see what they’ve registered for, and exploring the Stripe integration for any paid workshops. Security will be continuously reviewed, especially if new features are added (like user-generated content or payments). Overall, Theme42.org’s event platform will provide a modern, user-friendly hub for AI/GenAI meetups, utilizing a powerful but maintainable tech stack to simplify event management for the organizers.
